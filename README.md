# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This code is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game. 
The game generates a random choice for the computer and prompts the user to input their own choice. 
The game then compares the choices and declares a winner or a tie. 
The game continues until the user inputs "q" to quit.
The code begins by importing the random module and defining a list of possible choices for the game. 
It also defines variables for the computer's choice, the player's choice, the computer's score, and the player's score, and initializes them to appropriate values. 
The game is then played in a loop that continues until the player inputs "q" to quit.
Inside the loop, the code prompts the user to input their choice and stores it in the player variable. 
It then checks the value of the player variable and compares it to the computer's choice. 
If the choices are the same, the game declares a tie. 
If the player's choice is "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors", the code compares it to the computer's choice and declares a winner based on the rules of the game. 
If the player inputs "q", the loop is exited and the game ends. 
The scores for the computer and the player are also updated as the game progresses.
